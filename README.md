# Vodaka-Sales-Evaluation
SVEDKA founder Guillaume Cuvelier considered looking into historic U.S. vodka sales to evaluate the effect of new flavors, segment membership, and advertising. Consumer reactions to vodka advertising and pricing probably differed among the super-premium, premium, and value segments. New brand entries also may have had different price and advertising elasticities compared with the established brands. Finally, new flavors could have had a direct effect on vodka sales. Cuvelier wondered if he could quantify the financial value of his productâ€™s. . Understanding the value generated by each of the three campaigns from 1998 through 2005 would provide a good basis for the design of future campaigns.
